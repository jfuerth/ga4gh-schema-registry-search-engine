* clear reindexed schemas by registry+namespace, not whole registry
* enhance the Indexing UI functionality:
  * show "last indexed" results for each schema server and namespace
    * provide a "reindex" button (depends on "clear reindexed schemas by registry+namespace")

DONE
* split the schema documents by JSON Schema property (hook in at EmbeddingStoreIngestor.builder())
* include top-level description from inside JSON Schema as chunk metadata
* persist indexed stuff using pgvector
* figure out why 'smoking' no longer appears in the results: the schema endpoint returns a Data Connect table info response rather than a schema at the root.
* track the source URL of each document/segment in the index metadata
* Search UI: material CSS
* Search UI: show link to source schema registry in search results
* replace/update when re-indexing the same source
* handle errors better
  * let the indexing pipeline return Either<Error, IndexableSchema>
    * errors: IO problems, remote HTTP errors, JSON parse errors
    * notices: skipped namespaces or schemas that didn't match the filter
  * bubble these up to the top result
* Index UI:
  * render successes and errors better (colour codes, include exception message)
  * navigation bar
  * line up index form fields
* Search UI: show stats on the welcome page about how many sites, schemas, and schema fragments are in the index
