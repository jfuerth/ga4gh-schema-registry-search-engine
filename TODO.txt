!! figure out why 'smoking' no longer appears in the results

* make the UI look nicer:
  * navigation sidebar
  * material CSS
  * line up form fields
  * render errors
  * show link to source schema registry in search results
* handle errors better
  * let the indexing pipeline return Either<Error, IndexableSchema>
    * errors: IO problems, remote HTTP errors, JSON parse errors
    * notices: skipped namespaces or schemas that didn't match the filter
  * bubble these up to the top result

* improve pgvector persistence
  * replace/update when re-indexing the same source
  * track the source URL of each document/segment

DONE
* split the schema documents by JSON Schema property (hook in at EmbeddingStoreIngestor.builder())
* include top-level description from inside JSON Schema as chunk metadata
* persist indexed stuff using pgvector
